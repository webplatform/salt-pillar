# WebPlatform Salt Stack public pillar

In order to run [webplatform.org](https://www.webplatform.org/) in a consistent manner,
we rely on [Salt Stack](http://saltstack.com/) to manage our servers.

This repository holds YAML files that Salt Stack uses to mange our servers.

To learn more about the architecture,
refer to [the **Salt Master architecture** page](https://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Infrastructure/architecture/The_salt_master)
